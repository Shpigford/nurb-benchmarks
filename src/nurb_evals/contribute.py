"""The contribution wizard: one command from a person with a subscription to a
submission-ready leaderboard row.

Nobody should have to know that the harness spells its flagship "fable" or which
effort levels exist: the wizard detects the agent CLIs on PATH, offers a numbered
menu from the curated models.toml, runs the trials, sanitizes machine-specific paths
out of everything, stages the result under submissions/, and prints the two steps
that remain. Every question has a flag, so an agent can run it non-interactively:

    uv run python -m nurb_evals.contribute --harness claude --model claude-fable-5 --effort high
